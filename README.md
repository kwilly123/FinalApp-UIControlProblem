# FinalApp-UIControlProblem

## Description

The app starts off with the login screen where you can sign into the app using google sign-in.

Then when authenticated it will bring you to a new window where you can select your projects or create a new one. If not created just click the plus button and it will prompt you to name your project.

Select your project.

Now we are inside the project where you can see 6 tracks in a collection with a pan knob, volume slider, mute and solo button, and a label telling you which track it is.
As well as an eq window with 8 knobs that modify the whole frequency spectrum. (20hz-20khz)
A play button and a go back button that restarts the song.
